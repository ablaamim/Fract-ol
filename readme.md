Mandatory
</h3>

> <i>This project’s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a fractal is.
The constraints are as follows:<br>
• Your software should offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.<br>
• The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the
computer). This is the very principle of fractals.<br>
• You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. It’s even better if you hack away on psychedelic effects.<br>
• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly.<br>
• More parameters must be used for fractal parameters or ignored.<br>
• You must be able to create different Julia set with the parameters of the program.<br><br>
As for the graphic representation:<br>
• ESC will exit the program.<br>
• The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.</i>

Bonus
</h3>

• One more different fractal (there are more than a hundred different types of fractals
referenced online).<br>
• The zoom follows the actual mouse position.<br>
• In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows.<br>
• Make the color range shift.</i>
